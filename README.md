## Business Case

The purpose of this project is to predict Customer Churn using the Telco Customer Churn Data Set. This data set is available through the Kaggle link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Churn is defined as the percentage of customers who's business you lost during a set period of time. It can be calculated by dividing the amount of customers lost by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of this time frame.


## Goals

- Identify the most predictive features for Customer Churn
- Provide business recommendations on how to reduce Customer Churn
- Create a model that maximizes recall score because for this business case False Negatives are a bigger problem than Precision of the  model


## Features that most effect Customer Churn

**Increase Churn**: Fiber Optic Internet Sevice, Monthly Contract
**Decrease Churn**: Tenure, One/Two Year Contract, No Internet Service


## Buisness Recommendations

1. The fiber optic internet service is causing customers to leave but the Customers with no internet seem to be staying at a higher rate. This leads me to believe that the Internet Service is poor quality. Focus on improving the quality and coverage of the internet service.

2. Focus on signing up customers for a One/Two Year Contract as opposed to monthly. Offer incentives that the customer will only recieve via a yearly contract.

3. Offer loyalty rewards to long term customers to show your appreciation for their tenure

## Model

- Model was able to predict customer churn with a 75% accuracy
- Input customer data to predict whether they will churn
- Focus retention efforts on customers that are predicted to churn through promotional offers

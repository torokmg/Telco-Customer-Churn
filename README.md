## Business Case

The purpose of this project is to predict Customer Churn using the Telco Customer Churn Data Set. This data set is available through the Kaggle link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Churn is defined as the percentage of customers who's business you lost during a set period of time. It can be calculated by dividing the amount of customers lost by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of this time frame.

## Goals

1. Identify the most predictive features for Customer Churn

2. Provide business recommendations on how to reduce Customer Churn

3. Create a model that maximizes recall score because for this business case False Negatives are a bigger problem than Precision of the model

## Features that most effect Customer Churn

**Increase Churn**: Fiber Optic Internet Service, Monthly Contract 

**Decrease Churn**: Tenure, One/Two Year Contract, No Internet Service

## Business Recommendations

- The fiber optic internet service is causing customers to leave but the Customers with no internet seem to be staying at a higher rate. This leads me to believe that the Internet Service is poor quality. Focus on improving the quality and coverage of the internet service.

- Focus on signing up customers for a One/Two Year Contract as opposed to monthly. Offer incentives that the customer will only receive via a yearly contract.

- Offer loyalty rewards to long term customers to show your appreciation for their tenure

## Model

- Model was able to predict customer churn with a 83% accuracy

- Input customer data to predict whether they will churn

- Focus retention efforts on customers that are predicted to churn through promotional offers
